Decimal to Binary Converter

Description:
This program converts a decimal number to its binary representation. It splits the decimal number into its integer and decimal parts, converts each part to binary, and then combines them to form the binary representation of the original decimal number.

Files:
1. main.cpp - Contains the main function and user interaction.
2. decimal_to_binary_stack.cpp - Implements the conversion of the integer part to binary using a stack.
3. decimal_to_binary_queue.cpp - Implements the conversion of the decimal part to binary using a queue.
4. binary_conversion.h - Header file declaring functions for binary conversion.

Usage:
1. Compile all source files together.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Enter a decimal number when prompted.
4. The program will output the binary representation of the entered decimal number.

Compilation:
To compile the program, you can use any C++ compiler. Here's an example using g++:
